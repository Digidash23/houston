/**
 * The errand card: "open this screen, do the thing there, come back".
 *
 * It covers every task only the person's own hands can finish — a card on file,
 * a key Houston reveals once, files on their device, a space they alone may
 * destroy — because all of them are the same interaction and none of them can
 * carry a result back through the runtime.
 *
 * Nothing here can OBSERVE completion, which is what separates it from the
 * connect cards: no status poll can tell whether the person actually paid. So
 * the card asks instead of pretending, and both answers stand side by side from
 * the start — Open takes them to the screen, Done and Skip are the two honest
 * ways back. Open NAVIGATES, which tears this card down and rebuilds it when
 * the person returns, so the card keeps no state of its own: the outcome log
 * behind the stepper is the memory, and re-answering simply overwrites it.
 *
 * A screen this build does not know (a newer engine named it), and one this
 * person's own Houston does not hold (Billing for a plain member, the Danger
 * zone for anyone but the space owner), both say so and leave Skip as the way
 * on, rather than offering a button to nowhere.
 *
 * In the AI Manager's chat the two API errands do their job INLINE instead
 * (people dislike being sent out of the chat): a key is created and copied
 * right in the card, and an employee's IDs and setup prompt are shown there.
 * Anywhere else `apiKeys` keeps navigating ({@link inlineHandsOn}).
