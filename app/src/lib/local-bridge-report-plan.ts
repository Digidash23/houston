/**
 * What the app's one bridge report funnel (`reportLocalBridgeError`) does with
 * a rejection:
 *
 * - `cancelled`: the operation was superseded, not failed. A space, agent or
 *   session switch invalidated the bridge lifetime while a wake was waiting on
 *   its status GET, or the wake reached a controller already disposed. Nothing
 *   broke and the next scope wakes on its own, so nothing is reported anywhere
 *   (no toast, no Sentry, no quiet class) and the cause goes to the debug log
 *   only (HOUSTON-APP-5HX).
 * - `unsupported`: the deployment offers no bridge, the quiet
 *   `bridge_unsupported` class.
 * - `failed`: everything else stays loud. `cause` (error name + message) rides
 *   as `extra` beside the status and body, because the report error carries
 *   only the stack (PRODUCT-1833).
