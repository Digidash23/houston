/**
 * Starting an AI Employee's first day from the app: the setup task where it
 * introduces itself and interviews the user about how it should work,
 * persisting what the user says through its normal abilities (instructions,
 * Skills, Routines). "The agent creates itself."
 *
 * The host does the starting (`agents.startFirstDay`): it creates the task,
 * fires its hidden first turn on the brain the employee was hired with, and
 * records the start, once, however many buttons or tabs ask. This module only
 * opens what it started. A new hire's button shows the moment it is created,
 * so a press often lands before its pod is up: the SDK's start waits that out
 * on its own (the button stays pending), and the warming-write guard
 * deliberately leaves this call alone.
 *
 * The first thing the user reads is not a model turn: the chat renders a
 * hello as the task's first item from the name and job recorded here
 * (`lib/setup-mission-greeting.ts`), so it is whole before a cold engine has
 * warmed up. The hidden prompt tells the model that message was already read.
