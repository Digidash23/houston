 * The Memory tab's three writes, optimistic: the row appears, changes or
 * leaves the instant the user commits, and a refused write puts the list back
 * with an authored toast (`optimisticWrite`), unless `call()` already
 * showed copy of its own for it (offline, waking).
 *
 * Each resolves `true` once the file has the change and `false` when it was
 * refused, and never rejects: the card that sent it reopens with the typed
 * text on `false`, so a refusal never costs the user what they wrote.
