// update-policy.test.ts. What this pins is that the hook hands the decision
// the right trigger: the person's Retry on the launch overlay (which nothing
// else dismisses) reaches `download` as "user", so a release the disk
// refused is downloaded again once they have freed space, while the
// checker's automatic path stays latched.
