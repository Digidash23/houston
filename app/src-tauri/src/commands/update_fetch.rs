//! Resumable release download (PRODUCT-1727).
//!
//! `tauri-plugin-updater` fetches a release in ONE streamed request with no
//! retry: a 300 MB `Houston.app.tar.gz` on a flaky link dies mid-body as
//! "error decoding response body". This loop streams into a persisted partial
//! (`update_partial`) and asks the server for the rest with `Range` +
//! `If-Range` (GitHub release assets answer 206), backing off between
//! attempts. A budget that runs out KEEPS the file: the next call (the
//! 5-minute poll, the device coming back online) carries on from where it
//! stopped instead of from byte 0, which is the difference between a link that
//! drops every 100 MB finishing a 330 MB asset and never finishing it. A
//! server that answers a full body (200: it ignored the range, or the asset
//! was re-published and the validator no longer matches) restarts the file,
//! and the caller's tally with it through a fresh `Started` event. A transient
//! status from the release host (a 504 from GitHub's asset CDN mid-roll,
//! PRODUCT-1811) is retried the same way. Pure over a `reqwest::Client` so
//! the tests run it against a local socket.
