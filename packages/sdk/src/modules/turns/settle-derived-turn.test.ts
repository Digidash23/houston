/**
 * A settle that never learned its turn id (the user echo was lost) used to
 * fall back to the legacy heuristic: adopt the trailing assistant message if
 * the newest user row is our prompt. On a history that carries turn ids that
 * is wrong while the turn still runs: a native compaction persists its summary
 * marker (no turn id yet) as the trailing message BEFORE the reply exists, so
 * the pre-settled poll adopted the summary as the answer and stopped the
 * stream early. With turn ids in history the settle derives the id from our
 * user row and adopts only a later conclusive record under that id.
