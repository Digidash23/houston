 * (`reply_complete`), `running` again if the turn carried on, then the settle
 * — and each is a request of its own (the cloud's is a list read plus a
 * PATCH). Fired as they come, a slow start write could land AFTER the early
 * `needs_you` and leave a finished card reading "running".
 *
 * So every write to a card waits for the one queued before it, whichever turn
 * queued it: a send queued during the wrap-up starts the next turn the moment
 * this one settles, and that turn's `running` must land after this turn's
 * settle, never race it. The settle is queued AT the settle ({@link settle}),
 * before anything the settle triggers can queue.
 *
 * An early write is only a forecast: once any later write to the card is
 * queued (the turn carried on, settled, or the next turn began) it is skipped,
 * so it can neither flicker the card nor land on the next turn.
