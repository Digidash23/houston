/**
 * When typing in a composer readies the sandbox its send will run in.
 *
 * A prewarm starts only once the person has typed for
 * {@link PREWARM_TYPING_MS} without a pause longer than
 * {@link PREWARM_TYPING_GAP_MS}: a stray keystroke, or typing that starts and
 * stops, readies nothing, since a sandbox nobody sends to is pure cost. While
 * the gateway holds it (`holdMs` from the latest answer, 20 s), any keystroke
 * at least {@link PREWARM_REFRESH_MS} after the last request asks again and
 * extends the hold; once the hold has ended, the next prewarm waits for the
 * person to type on again. A new chat has no id until its first send, so the
 * id is minted here and handed to that send by
 * {@link DraftPrewarm.claimNewConversationId}. Only a send to the SAME
 * conversation attaches to the sandbox, which is why the two must agree.
 *
 * Package self-references only: the app's node:test runner loads this file
 * through the `@houston/sdk/draft-prewarm` subpath, and node resolves no
 * extensionless relative import.
