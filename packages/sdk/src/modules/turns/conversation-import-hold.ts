/**
 * Imports the page abandoned mid-flight, kept until they can be sent again.
 *
 * An import aborted because the document was leaving is neither landed nor
 * failed: nothing is known. The promise the caller holds stays pending, and
 * the import is sent again when the page proves to be alive: the lifecycle
 * port says so (`onLive`: a back/forward-cache restore, a cancelled
 * navigation), or the hold's own timer fires. Timers do not run on a dead
 * page and pause in the back/forward cache, so a timer that fires IS the
 * page being alive, whatever the port's flag says (a `pagehide` with no
 * `pageshow` after it would otherwise leave the flag stuck). A page that
 * really left never settles its promise, which costs it nothing; the import
 * is still owed (the outbox) and the next load sends it.
 *
 * The hold only ever opens on a page that was leaving, so a resend that gets
 * no answer from the host (a transport drop, which is also what the browser
 * reports for a request the leaving page aborted) stays held and tries again
 * on the next timer; only the host's own answer settles it. The timer backs
 * off, doubling to a cap, so a live page that went offline is not asked
 * every three seconds for good, and resets when the port says live. One hold
 * per import: a second ask for the same (agent, conversation, importId) joins
 * the first, and one resend in flight at a time.
