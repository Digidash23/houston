/**
 * WHY a turn ended in an `error` session status, read from the typed input of
 * the settle that produced it (the notice kind, the SDK's own message
 * constants, the typed provider card), never from the chat copy. The copy is
 * product voice that deliberately hides the cause (HOU-705): once a surface
 * sees "Something went wrong. Please try again." a transport drop, a host
 * failure and a thrown bug are one and the same. Rides additively on
 * {@link SessionStatusDetail} so a surface can count failures by cause.
 *
 * - `stopped`: the person pressed Stop.
 * - `engine_restart`: the engine died mid-turn and parked the turn for a
 *   "continue" (the `engine_restart` notice).
 * - `send_busy` / `compute_busy`: a send that ran out of hold budget behind a
 *   running turn / with no room on the shared compute.
 * - `turn_died`: the terminal frame was lost and history holds no reply.
 * - `send_lost`: the send failed at the transport level and nothing proved
 *   the turn started.
 * - `stream_lost`: the resumable stream exhausted its reconnect budget.
 * - `agent_too_large` / `agent_setup_failed`: a pooled turn that failed before
 *   any provider work (H-003, the `TurnSetupFailure` codes): the agent holds
 *   more than a worker can open / any other setup code. Two classes, not one
 *   `setup_failed`: the first is unretryable and sized by the agent's data,
 *   the second is a transient worker fault, so they are fixed, and counted,
 *   apart. Both are `failure`: the line is authored, but the cause is ours
 *   (the SDK already reports each one, `turnFailureReport`), so a surface
 *   counts them as errors shown, never as handled states.
 * - `turn_unconfirmed`: an accepted turn whose conversation never appeared
 *   and whose end never reached us (the pre-settled poll's bound). Its own
 *   class rather than `unexplained`: nothing failed that we know of, so a
 *   dashboard must tell "lost after the 202" from "threw". Also `failure`
 *   (reported as `turn_gone_after_accept`).
 * - `unexplained`: the turn failed with no engine verdict (a transport drop,
 *   a thrown bug); the raw cause is in the frontend log.
 * - `engine_verdict`: the engine's own error copy (a wire `error` frame, a
 *   refused send) matching no typed state.
 * - `provider_<kind>`: a typed provider card (`ProviderError.kind`), the
 *   client-built not-connected card (`provider_unauthenticated`) and a plan
 *   refusal (`provider_plan_message_limit`) included.
