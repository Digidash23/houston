 * predate the prompt, and seeding it would replace the turn on screen. So it
 * is taken again once that turn let go: by then the host has the prompt and
 * the reply, or refused the send and never will. A read sent after the
 * engine took the send is trusted: the host holds the prompt, and a running
 * turn's stream owns the feed anyway.
 *
 * Waiting matters for the first read a chat opens on. Its caller (a query's
 * first fetch) joins every change event that lands while it is out, so this
 * read is the only one the chat gets until the next change.
 *
 * It reads again for as long as reads keep being overtaken: each pass waits
 * out a whole turn, so it cannot storm. A teardown ends it unseeded.
