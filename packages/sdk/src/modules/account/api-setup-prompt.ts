/**
 * The prompt a person pastes into a coding agent (Claude Code, Cursor, Codex)
 * to wire one AI Employee into their own code through the Houston API. One
 * builder for every surface: the employee's API access screen copies it, and
 * the AI Manager points people at that screen instead of writing its own.
 *
 * It NEVER carries a key. A copied prompt lands in chat histories and repos, so
 * it names the `HOUSTON_API_KEY` environment variable instead and tells the
 * coding agent to ask for the key, never to print, hardcode or commit it.
 * Copying the prompt mints nothing.

Connection details:
- Base URL: ${base}
- Agent ID: ${input.agentId}
- Organization ID: ${input.orgId}

Every request sends these two headers:
- Authorization: Bearer <the API key>
- x-houston-org: ${input.orgId}

The API key: read it from the ${env} environment variable. If it is not set, stop and ask me for it. I create keys in the Houston app under Settings > API keys. Never print the key, hardcode it, log it, or commit it.

How the API works:
1. Start a task (a "mission"): POST ${missions} with JSON {"input": "what to do"}. The response is the mission; keep its "id".
2. Follow it live: GET ${missions}/<id>/events (Server-Sent Events).
3. Read the result: GET ${missions}/<id>. "status" ends as completed, failed or canceled, and "result" holds the answer.
Optional: add "webhook": {"url": "https://...", "secret": "..."} when starting a mission to get a POST when it finishes.
