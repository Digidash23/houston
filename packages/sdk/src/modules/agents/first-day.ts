/**
 * An AI Employee's first day: the setup task where it introduces itself and
 * interviews the user about how it should work. A new hire is born with its
 * first day pending (`AgentCreateInput.config`), and this is the ONE way it
 * starts, for every surface and the AI Manager alike.
 *
 * The host decides everything: it creates the task, fires its first turn on
 * the brain the employee was hired with, and records the start, all in one
 * operation under the employee's own lock. So a repeated start (a second
 * button, a second tab, a retry after a lost answer) is safe by construction:
 * it hands back the task the first start made, with `outcome: "existing"`.
 * That is also why the start, unlike other writes, rides out a pod that is
 * still coming up: a new hire's first day is offered the moment it is created,
 * often seconds before its pod answers, and a repeated start can only hand back
 * the same task.

 * @param agentId The agent this acts on, by the id listAgents returns. An
 *   agent's name is not its id, so read the id from listAgents first.
 * @param input `locale` is the user's app language (for example "es"), which
 *   the whole first conversation is held in; `title` is the task's name on the
 *   board, in that language. Both are optional.
 * @assistant group:agents
 * @assistant confirm: money. It starts a real conversation right away, which spends model budget.
