 * The body is judged by the protocol's one parser, the same the host's
 * refusal is pinned against, so the classifier and the copy that names the
 * floor can never disagree about what counts.
 *
 * Dependency-free beyond that protocol subpath and erasable-syntax-only: the
 * app's node:test entry points load it through the
 * `@houston/sdk/routines/plan-floor-quiet` subpath.
