 * Who may create or rotate a routine's incoming-webhook key. The gateway

 * routine on its creator's credentials, and a rotation retires the creator's
 * live address, so no org role overrides it. A routine with no recorded
 * creator fires on the space's own credential, so only the space owner may
 * mint for it.
 *
 * This is the client half of that rule, judged on what every surface already
 * holds (the routine's `created_by`, the signed-in user, whether the viewer
 * owns the space), so a surface offers the action only when the gateway would
 * accept it. The gateway stays the enforcer: its `403 not_creator` is the
 * typed refusal below.
 *
 * Dependency-free and erasable-syntax-only: the app's node:test entry points
 * load it through the `@houston/sdk/routines/webhook-key-access` subpath.
