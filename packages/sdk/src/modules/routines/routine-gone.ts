/**
 * Whether a failed routine write or run-now was refused because the routine
 * no longer exists (`404 routine_not_found`): deleted elsewhere, or picked
 * from a list a stale mirror served. Reads the adapter's parsed `body`, a raw
 * text `body`, or the SDK's own error, whose message is the response text. A
 * 404 for anything else (`agent not found` above all) never matches.
 *
 * An expected state with its own copy; the surface also refetches the list so
 * the routine disappears. A burst of them still means a stale mirror, which
 * is ours to fix, so every surface reports it as one fingerprinted warning.
 *
 * Dependency-free beyond that wire subpath and erasable-syntax-only: the
 * app's node:test entry points load it through the
 * `@houston/sdk/routines/routine-gone` subpath.
