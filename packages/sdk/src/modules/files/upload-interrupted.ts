/**
 * An upload whose request died mid-flight: the transport gave up before any
 * answer came back. Distinct from the device being offline, which is how every
 * surface used to read it (HOUSTON-APP-5CG): the edge proxy cut any body still
 * uploading at 60 s (Traefik's default `readTimeout`), so a slow attachment
 * failed every retry while the rest of the app answered fine, and the person
 * was told they were offline.
 *
 * Typed so a surface names the upload ("your files didn't finish") and so the
 * report keeps how long the request ran and how big it was, the two numbers
 * that tell a proxy timeout from a dropped connection.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT chained to the transport `TypeError` as its `cause`: every
 * client's offline classifier unwraps one level of `cause`, and this must not
 * read as offline. The raw transport message rides in this error's message.
 *
 * Dependency-free and erasable-syntax-only: the app's node:test entry points
 * load it through the `@houston/sdk/files/upload-interrupted` subpath.
