// Why routine runs fail, and why the engine pauses a routine that keeps failing.

/**
 * Why a routine run failed at the credential level (PRODUCT-1475). A routine
 * fires on its CREATOR's credential scope, so the person reading the run's
 * history may have their own account connected and still see it fail — the run
 * has to name whose account is the problem, and what the remedy is.
 *
 * `creator_*` = the routine creator's own account; `team_*` = the space's
 * single shared account. `out_of_credits` is a VALID credential with no quota
 * left, which reconnecting would not fix. `model_unavailable` = the account
 * works but cannot run the model the routine uses; picking another model fixes
 * it.

 * model for the routine fixes it. `usage_limit`: the account's subscription
 * plan used up its usage window (Anthropic's 5-hour session or weekly model
 * limit); it heals by itself at `resets_at`, so it never counts toward an
 * auto-pause and instead snoozes the routine (`Routine.snoozed`).
