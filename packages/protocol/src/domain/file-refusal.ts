 * raises it (`packages/host/src/turn/files-path.ts`), the client classifies on
 * it (`app/src/lib/file-conflicts.ts`), and the fake host answers with it. A
 * status cannot identify a state — the moment the route grows a SECOND 409 or
 * a second 403, a client that keyed on the status explains the new state with
 * the old one's copy and silences the report along with it. Two hand-kept
 * copies of the union would reach that same failure one release later, which
 * is the whole reason there is only one here.
