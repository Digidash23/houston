 *   (desktop, a standing pod) a lost segment is gone for good, and failing
 *   the read would fail every turn of that chat forever.
 * - `throw`: refuse. A reader that ships the whole document elsewhere (a
 *   transcript repair replaces the remote copy) must never ship that hole as
 *   the transcript.
 *
 * A pool turn's tree holds only a chat's newest segments; its readers fetch
 * the rest first (turn/turn-archive-fetch.ts), and that fetch throws when the
 * store itself lacks one.
