 * revision BEFORE its file: a doc PUT another writer lands after that read is
 * a 409 here, and a writer that landed earlier wrote a file this read sees.
 * So a newer projection is never replaced by an older one. A family with no
 * file only fills a missing doc (the pod's projector answers the empty doc);
 * a file no salvage can read is never projected over its doc. A failure gets
 * one more round; what still fails is reported, never thrown.
