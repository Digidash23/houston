/**
 * Workspace path guard — the wall that keeps the agent's file tools inside its
 * workspace (cloud security Gate #1).
 *
 * pi's built-in file tools resolve model-supplied paths with `resolveToCwd`,
 * which honors absolute paths, `~`, a leading `@`, and file:// URLs — so a
 * prompt-injected agent could read /etc/passwd or its own auth.json with no
 * bash tool at all. `clamp` re-resolves the raw path the way pi does, requires
 * the result (and its symlink-resolved real path) to land inside the workspace
 * root, and returns the absolute path the tool is then forced to use.
 * Shared roots (the org-shared mirror) get the same discipline — agents edit
 * the org original there by design. Callers rewrite the tool's path param to the clamped result, so a
 * normalization divergence from pi cannot escape an allowed root.
 *
 * Containment is not the only shape a wall takes. A runtime whose whole job is
 * ONE document — the coordinator, which keeps no work of its own and only ever
 * consolidates its memory — gets `allowedFiles` instead: an exact list of the
 * documents its tools may touch, plus `readableDirs` it may only read (the
 * attachments people send it), with every other path refused
 * (fs-guard-narrow.ts). Narrowing to what a role actually needs is what keeps a
 * prompt injection there from rewriting a shared skill every agent runs, or the
 * runtime's own session records.
 *
 * Containment alone is NOT enough: the runtime's own dataDir sits INSIDE the
 * workspace root (`<agentDir>/.houston/runtime`, wired in the host's
 * `dataDirFor`), so the credential files — `auth.json`, every team member's
 * `auth-users/<hash>.json`, and a materialized `claude-login/.credentials.json`
 * — resolve to legal in-workspace paths. On a shared team pod that would let one
 * prompt-injected agent read the whole space's live provider tokens with no bash
 * tool at all. Hence the second rule, in fs-guard-containment.ts: a DENY list of
 * credential path segments that every allowed root enforces, for reads and
 * writes alike.
