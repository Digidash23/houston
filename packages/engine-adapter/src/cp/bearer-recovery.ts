 * gateway has rejected a bearer. Split out so the transport file stays
 * readable and so the one piece of state this needs — which bearers the
 * gateway has ALREADY rejected — has a single owner.
 *
 * Why that memory exists (PRODUCT-1737): on a wake-from-sleep burst the bearer
 * the gateway sees is not one value. Several parallel reads go out holding the
 * slept-out token, the proactive identity timer mints a new one on its own
 * schedule, and the seam's refresh answers a third caller. Comparing the
 * refresher's answer only with the bearer THIS request sent (`fresh ===
 * bearer`, PRODUCT-1664) cannot tell "the gateway has already rejected this
 * exact token on a sibling request" apart from "a genuinely new mint". The
 * first replay of a rejected mint stays loud — a fresh bearer the gateway
 * refuses is a real bug — but its siblings must not each file the same
 * report, and a request that only learned of the rejection from a sibling
 * must not fire a replay it already knows the answer to.

 * the session is gone (HOU-1106's three-valued contract) — an expected
 * lifecycle state, answered with the quiet synthetic signed-out 401 so a burst
 * of live queries caught holding the stale bearer doesn't file a report per
 * query while the sign-in screen mounts (HOUSTON-APP-4WR). With NO refresher
 * installed, null only means "nobody to ask" (static tokens, tests, the
 * pre-mount boot window), so the gateway's own 401 stands.
 *
 * A refresher answering a bearer the gateway has ALREADY rejected — the one
 * this request sent (securetoken hands back the still-cached idToken when
 * asked twice inside one token's lifetime, PRODUCT-1664) or one a sibling
 * request just had refused (PRODUCT-1737) — is not a mint worth replaying: the
 * answer is known. It takes the same quiet path. A genuinely NEW bearer is
 * replayed once; a 401 to THAT replay is verified once more after a beat, and
 * only a bearer refused twice is returned raw — by one caller, so a fresh mint
 * the gateway keeps rejecting still surfaces as the real bug it is, without a
 * report per query (PRODUCT-1812). A refreshed bearer whose own `exp` is
 * already past never reaches that path at all: `./refresh-bearer.ts` asks the
 * refresher once more before anything is sent (HOUSTON-APP-5HZ).
