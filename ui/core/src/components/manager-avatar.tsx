 * inside the one thing no employee wears: a thin halo of the same material,
 * set off from the disc by a gap of empty air. The halo covers nothing of the
 * helmet, and the gap shows whatever surface the mark sits on (a row at rest,
 * hovered or selected). It is drawn outside the `size` box, which the SVG
 * lets overflow, so the disc keeps the employee avatars' diameter and column.
 *
 * The disc wears the Button's resting fill and its 1px inset rim, the helmet
 * wears the Button's label colour, the halo the Button's fill, each read from
 * the same `--ht-cta*` token the Button reads, so the mark matches it in both
 * themes and every palette and follows any change to it. Flat, like the
 * Button. The dark Button's backdrop blur is an effect, not a colour, and is
 * left out: the mark sits on its row's own surface, where a blur changes no
 * pixel and would only cost a compositing layer. The helmet takes the
 * employee avatar's ratio at the rendered size, so it sits on whole pixels
 * exactly as it does in a HoustonAvatar of that size. Decorative: the
 * Manager's label beside it is the accessible name.
